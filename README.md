# A Template for Research Proposal Report

The template for research proposal report required by Rice university department of physics and astronomy. It is adapted from a PhD thesis template from 20th centry. I want it to make the title page, but don't want every section to be 0.x as this report does not need chapters. Bibliography is changed to reference list.

The text area is made larger, because I do not want to waste paper. This is done manually so might introduce some errors.

Should work on [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).
