\section{XENONnT experiment}

Is a dual phase xenon time projection chamber for WIMP search\cite{Aprile_2020}.

\subsection{Working principle}
We get S1 and S2 from the detector and infer (x,y,z) and energy as well as interaction type from S1 and S2.

Is designed for WIMP search. Works great for low energy.
